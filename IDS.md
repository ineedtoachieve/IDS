# Arithmetic Expression Examples

In this section, we will explore various arithmetic expressions. We'll cover operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, we'll delve into more complex expressions involving variables and constants. Let's start with some basic examples to get a solid grasp of arithmetic operations.


```python
# Multiplication
result_multiply = 5 * 3

# Addition
result_add = 5 + 3

result_multiply, result_add
```


```python
def convert_minutes_to_hours(minutes):
    hours = minutes / 60
    return hours

# Example usage
minutes = 120
hours = convert_minutes_to_hours(minutes)

hours
```

## Objectives

- Understand basic data science concepts.
- Familiarize yourself with essential data science tools and languages.
- Practice arithmetic expressions and conversions.
